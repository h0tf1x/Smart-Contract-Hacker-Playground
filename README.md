# Smart Contract Hacker Playground 

## Challenges :muscle:

### Parity Hacks 1/2 

The [challenge](./Parity_1_2/REAMDME.md) contains two levels that are based on the Parity hacks from July (Level 1) and November 2017 (Level 2). The contracts have been slightly modified so they work with a more recent version of the compiler. 

### PoWH Coin 
PoWH or "Proof of Weak Hands" coin was advertised as a legitimate pyramid scheme that ran for several months between end of 2017 and beginning 2018. The [challenge](./PoWH_Coin/REAMDME.md)  is based on the hack that put an end to the coin ultimately and where about ~1000 Ether was lost to the attackers.



## Installation :minidisc:

- Make sure you have `nodejs` 10.x and `npm` 6.x installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

## Launch a challenge :rocket:

After installation simply change to the directory of the challenge and launch the level with `start_level`

```
