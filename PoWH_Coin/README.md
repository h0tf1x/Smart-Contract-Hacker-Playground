# PoWH coin hacking challenge

## Level 1 :video_game:

It's Friday night and life is good. You are about to start the new Star Wars movie that you have not seen yet. You know it's likely gonna be crappy, despite what your friends keep telling you. Deep down you know Disney should have never been allowed to take over. You have a deep sip of single malt whiskey to try to put the critical voice in your head to rest and are about to start the movie. Suddenly you hear your phone ring, you look at the screen and see that it's your good friend Fomo. He is a nice guy and fun to hang out with. The thing with Fomo is that he is not very bright when it comes to investing. He got into crypto end of 2017 and he generally thinks that everything in crypto is going to the moon. His specialty is to buy into the shittiest coins that are out there despite your advise. After a view rings you decide to take the call. You find Fomo very distressed, he is going on about this PoWH coin and that he made 10x and then bought more and more ... You can't understand everything he is saying ... he is very upset. He goes on about a vulnerability that someone is exploiting and stealing all the ETH that are in the PoWH contract. You open up Reddit to find out what on earth the PoWH coin is ... great it's a pyramid scheme ... well done Fomo. He asks for your help to steal the rest of the coins before the attacker is able to take them and return them to Fomo and his fellow investor friends. You are annoyed ... but more so intrigued.
